venus came solar system in 1949 1950 scientists planet wanted books banned publication actually boycotted anyone would pub work his theory said venus extremely hot800 degrees fahrenheit that planet weird rotation that possibly came solar system around time joseph egypt 400 years later caused plagues egypt moses that placed biblical times well venus weird day it longer year venus full hydrocarbons carbon dioxide it atmosphere much thicker earths all sort lend credit theory it volcanic hot surface in 1950 astronomers guessing venus twin earth slightly higher temperature possibly 150 equator comfortable poles then russian drones sent venus told entirely different story blew astronomers water i hope i embarrassing efforts ban man publication he spent years princeton university leaving russia two aspects theory make us sit listen he claimed hydrocarbons rained oil surface earth might lot earths supply oil came the russians acting theory find new oil reserves the second aspect venus played kind bounce game came solar system removed second planet sun process dumped solar system he thought mars originally orbit venus today his theory mankind forgot happened kind national amnesia if says true mars could thick enough atmosphere water support life more important might thick magnetic layer filtered sun kept planet temperate one time all ruined venus dragged orbit that might happened biblical times the earth might slightly closer sun 360 day year instead 365 quarter day year this course speculation go find real truth going my guess life mars caves surface slightly heavier atmosphere possibly seas huge caverns if surface life left likely size dog racoon if large life i suspect sand worms deep sands mars i mention easy ridicule ideas the one i told

way shows evidence djohn1 you quite right it wild speculation part except temperature evidence venus rotates wrong direction spin day it planet entire solar system the day 268 days long the year 222 days that temperatures high could closeness sun the atmosphere 15 times thicker planets atmosphere that speaks something unusual going as oil showing places rain oil might explain the critical thing

cometlike orbit somewhere road return causing kinds changes solar system if planets around planets might cause lot destruction come close existing planets moons solar system our planets viewed north top solar system rotate around sun counterclockwise if brown dwarf rotating clockwise around sun might complicate finding plotting orbit if way angle planets orbit sun might also keep discovered i

clear i saying outcome november 8th as i recently told national television audience i know going win in article i simply going examine poll numbers electoral map currently stand but bizarre election things literally change overnight entirely possible could still another october surprise two said done and without doubt donald trump desperately needs something move needle election held today hillary clinton would almost certainly win what witnessed far 2016 election season absolutely unprecedented just consider things seen point time we never bigger october surprise release lewd audio tape 11 years ago donald trump claimed grope women without consent we never seen mainstream media openly attack presidential candidate much attacked donald trump in past big mainstream news outlets least pretended fair balanced year completely discarded notions objectivity they completely utterly ashamed matter wins election never able get integrity back we also never seen major party war close presidential election it said house divided surely fall whole host prominent republican leaders openly attempting sabotage trump campaign if donald trump able overcome factors truly miracle biblical proportions as stands moment however numbers looking quite ominous trump right real clear politics average national polls hillary clinton ahead 62 percent most political experts consider insurmountable lead stage game but even trump close gap pull ahead mean win election in fact trump could beat clinton millions votes nationally still lose in order win election one candidate got get 270 electoral votes and latest real clear politics electoral map 262 electoral votes projected go hillary clinton 164 electoral votes projected go donald trump 112 electoral votes toss category so unless something dramatically changes donald trump essentially going run table closely contested states order win mathematical odds happening extremely slim lets take closer look the first thing donald trump going order get 270 electoral votes win states mitt romney 2012 that would get 206 electoral votes unfortunately looks like may difficult romney north carolina six recent polls clinton ahead state romney also arizona recent poll taken clinton ahead five points but moment lets assume trump win states romney on top four states trump must win 1 trump must win floridas 29 electoral

potentially keep donald trump hillary clinton getting 270 electoral votes election super close if happens election would thrown house representatives it projected house still controlled republicans election choice would come either trump mcmullin backing mcmullin believe would realistic shot scenario i know sounds strange actually discussed around family dinner tables utah tonight and recent days evan mcmullin soaring utah one recent survey shows trump one point lead mcmullin another recent survey actually show mcmullin leading trump four points state so trump could pull miracle everything else needs get 270 electoral votes utah could end messing everything in addition also important keep mind trump could actually get legitimate votes needs win still stolen election fraud

as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by

              " 'страна китай заявления кндр о завершении своей программы развития ядерного оружия вызвали всплеск дискуссий на тему кто виноват точнее кто несет главную ответственность за то что ситуация дошла до нынешнего уровня и на фоне развивающегося противостояния сша и кнр пекин начали обвинять еще и в этом причем разброс обвинений разнится от ничего не делал хотя мог до активно помогал начнем с высказываний кандидата в президенты сша хиллари клинтон 13 октября 2016 г агентство associated press ссылаясь на сайт wikileaks сообщило что еще в июне 2013 года в ходе лекции среди должностных лиц goldman sachs хиллари клинтон указала на то что народноосвободительная армия китая является главным спонсором кндр и уже тогда обозначила позицию о том что если пекину не удастся сдержать кндр от создания межконтинентальной баллистической ракеты способной нести ядерное оружие сша могут взять китай в кольцо системы про и военноморских баз японская санкэй симбун цитирует министра обороны сша эштона картера на китае лежит большая ответственность за нынешние действия кндр он покрывает опасное поведение этой страны и подводит аудиторию к мысли о том что налицо заговор пекина который постоянно получая от сша за великодержавную политику решил ответить вашингтону таким образом в доказательство японцы ссылаются на чосон ильбо которая сообщила что по словам бывшего сотрудника разведывательного управления министерства обороны сша брюса вектора bruce vector озвученным 1 сентября северокорейская ракета это точная копия китайской двухступенчатой твердотопливной баллистической ракеты цзюйлан1 которая размещается на подлодках выступая с лекцией в сеульском государственном университете помощник госсекретаря сша тони блинкен также заявил что о северокорейской экономике невозможно говорить без упоминания о китае пхеньян полностью зависит от сотрудничества с пекином поэтому на китае лежит особая ответственность в реализации антисеверокорейских санкций цель подобных обвинений вынудить кнр быть более конструктивной между тем в заявлениях китайских политиков постоянно проговаривается что япкп не вызвана действиями пекина и кнр не располагает волшебным ключом к её разрешению корни проблемы берут начало в противоречиях между сша и кндр и конструктивный подход должна проявлять америка как отметила 12 сентября 2016 г официальный представитель мид кнр хуан чуньин суть ядерной проблемы корейского полуострова заключается в противоречии между кндр и сша и американская сторона должна взять на себя ответственность мы еще раз призываем все стороны смотреть на общую ситуацию действовать осмотрительно и избегать взаимных провокаций совместно продвигать процесс денуклеаризации прилагать реальные усилия для достижения мира и стабильности на корейском полуострове сказала китайский дипломат отметив что сегодняшнее развитие ситуации свидетельствует о важности и неотложности скорейшего возвращения к шестисторонним переговорам 14 сентября в газете жэньминь жибао были отвергнуты американские предложения о том что кнр должна принимать активное участие в изоляции кндр там заявляют что основную долю ответственности за текущую ситуацию несет не кндр а сша 21 сентября на своей речи в оон премьерминистр ли кэцян также не упоминал про санкции 2 ноября 2016 г хуа чуньин вновь заявила что одними санкциями и давлением добиться коренного решения проблемы корейского полуострова невозможно комментируя недавнюю встречу глав делегаций сша и республики корея на шестисторонних переговорах в ходе которой вновь прозвучали призывы ужесточить санкции и усилить давление в отношении кндр в надежде что новая резолюция совета безопасности оон введет принудительное ограничение экспорта северокорейской угольной продукции хуа чуньин указала что рассмотрение и обсуждение северокорейской ядерной проблемы в сб оон идет однако в важной содержательной части резолюции 2270 сб оон говорится о необходимости возобновить шестисторонние переговоры и стремиться к разрядке напряженности в северовосточной азии политическими и дипломатическими средствами это и есть путь коренного решения северокорейской ядерной проблемы а двумя днями позже 4 ноября она же заявила что размещение американской системы противоракетной обороны на корейском полуострове подорвёт стратегический баланс сил в регионе и пекин оставляет за собой право принять необходимые меры для защиты собственной безопасности действия сша противоречат усилиям по обеспечению мира и стабильности на корейском полуострове сказала хуа чуньин призвав соответствующие стороны учитывать законную обеспокоенность китая в основе такой политики кнр как проблема thaad которую кнр видит направленной на сдерживание его ракетного потенциала так и более широкое восприятие антисеверокорейских военных приготовлений сша как направленных на деле против кнр в результате несмотря на ряд острых противоречий между странами в отношениях пекина и пхеньяна работает принцип враг моего врага мой друг проще поддерживать кндр на плаву чем рисковать более серьезными последствиями которые могут наступить если её прижмут слишком сильно готовность китая расследовать нелегальные торговые связи ряда китайских компаний с кндр показывает что окно не закрыто полностью и это можно рассматривать как попытку ослабить американские усилия по введению санкций против китайских компаний ведущих дела с кндр легальным образом одновременно китай и северная корея расширяют экономическое сотрудничество несмотря на действие международных санкций как сообщила газета нодон синмун 25 октября в пхеньяне состоялась третье заседание межправительственной комиссии кндр и кнр по пограничным вопросам китайскую сторону возглавлял заместитель министра иностранных дел лю чжэньминь а северокорейскую заместитель главы мид пак мён гук обсуждались вопросы организации нового пограничного перехода ибо уже в сентябре нынешнего года построен мост между северокорейским городом синыйчжу и китайским хуньчунем кроме того в ближайшем будущем будет открыт мост между синыйчжу и китайским даньдуном кроме того товарооборот между ск и китаем в третьем квартале нынешнего года по сравнению с тем же периодом прошлого года вырос на 34 в сэз расон китайцы строят новые склады и офисы что означает приток инвестиций резко вырос импорт машин из кндр в кнр вырос и импорт китайского риса по данным таможенного управления китая в сентябре 2016 года из китая в кндр поставлено 18477 тонн зерновых культур это в 27 раза больше чем в августе и в 6 раз больше чем в сентябре прошлого года в сентябре импортировано 16 тыс тонн риса что на 2 тыс тонн больше чем в период с января по август и хотя южнокорейские эксперты объясняют это решением северокорейского руководства о стабилизации цен на рис поскольку запасы риса сделанные в прошлом году фактически исчерпаны с некоторого времени у них любой факт имеющий отношение к кндр расценивается только как знак скорого голода и краха в общем пока одна сторона обвиняет и бряцает оружием другая ищет способы урегулирования проблемы и это хорошо показывает кто мог бы подключиться к установлению диалога но не желает этого константин асмолов

siquiera algunos documentos que permitieran apreciar escudriñar sobre si los candidatos propuestos tenían los requisitos que la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva exige como son reconocida solvencia moral una amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas que representen entidad interés particular alguno obviamente estos requisitos deben acreditarse con documentos deducirse inferirse del aire por tratarse de hechos macizos sostenidos en el tiempo tampoco supeditarse el voto consignas partidarias amén de la subida trascendencia del elegido petitorio que en estricta aplicación del artículo 40 del código procesal constitucional que permite interponer demanda de amparo cualquier persona por violaciones los derechos difusos que gocen de reconocimiento constitucional

dejar sin efecto de la resolución legislativa n 00820162017cr de 27102016 publicada en el peruano el 28102016 del procedimiento especial parlamentario que le sirve de antecedente de la misma fecha donde se omitió adrede el debate se adoptó acuerdos vía votación ilegítima sin previo debate que el reglamento del congreso exige artículo 64 pasos procedimentales que son de obligatorio cumplimiento por estar previstos en normas especiales atinentes precisamente la elección de los miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva que le compete al congreso tal como lo prevé el artículo 86 de nuestra carta política fundamentos de hecho jurídicos 1 derecho contar con funcionarios públicos elegidos legítimamente el artículo 86 de la constitución política se ocupa expresamente de la elección por el congreso de tres 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva por lo tanto los ciudadanos tenemos el derecho que esta selección elección sea minuciosa ponderada responsable legítima contando con los elementos de juicio del caso no se elige ciegas por consignas inalámbricas sin verle la cara al elegido sin escucharlo sin examinar quién es como en realidad se hizo se violó pues con suma torpeza esta norma constitucional como quiera que la propia constitución política consigna otros ingredientes de tal elección ella misma se remite que sea el reglamento del congreso el que la desarrolle de eso se ocupa el artículo 94 de la misma carta política cuando establece el congreso elabora aprueba su reglamento que tiene fuerza de ley con este reglamento el congreso opera actúa funciona discreción de la presidenta pero aún de una persona particular como keiko fujimori con tal sentido propósito el aludido vigente reglamento del congreso trata expresamente de la elección de esos tres directores en un llamado procedimiento parlamentario especial el mismo que ha sido burlado transgredido violado pese su asidero constitucional su indiscutido rango legal veamos lo que establece su artículo 64 inciso c del procedimiento especial como uno de los 3 procedimientos parlamentarios los procedimientos parlamentarios son el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del congreso destinados producir leyes resoluciones legislativas actos de control político designaciones nombramientos pueden ser procedimiento legislativo que comprende el debate aprobación de leyes ordinarias leyes orgánicas leyes autoritativas para ejercer la legislación delegada leyes presupuestales financieras leyes de demarcación territorial leyes de reforma de la constitución política del reglamento del congreso de resoluciones legislativas b procedimientos del control político que comprende la investidura del consejo de ministros la interpelación los ministros la invitación los ministros para que informen las preguntas los ministros la solicitud de información los ministros la administración en general la censura la extensión de confianza los ministros la investigación sobre cualquier asunto de interés público la dación de cuenta el antejuicio político c procedimientos especiales que comprende la designación del contralor la elección del defensor del pueblo de los miembros del tribunal constitucional de 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva así como la ratificación del presidente de dicho banco del superintendente de banca seguros artículo modificado aprobado por el pleno del congreso de fecha 6 de marzo de 1998 en consecuencia el procedimiento especial donde resultaron elegidos los 03 directores en cuestión vulneró violó lo que dispone la parte general e introductoria de este artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso aplicable aquél respecto de todo procedimiento parlamentario que es definido como el conjunto de actos sucesivos e integrados que se realizan para promover el debate los acuerdos del congreso destinados producirresoluciones legislativas actos de control político designaciones nombramientos lo real apodíctico fue que en aquella sesión donde se produjo la elección hubo debate alguno por lo que se examinó nada que permita colegir que se eligieron escogieron quienes tenían una reconocida solvencia moral quizá amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas todo fue un remedo como se podrá fácilmente advertir la elección del jueves 27102016 se hizo en un procedimiento especial reglamentario sino en uno trucado sin promover el debate además sin adoptar los acuerdos como producto de dicho debate por lo tanto solo se transgredió el artículo 86 de la constitución política sino también la primera parte además el inciso c del artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso de expreso fundamento constitucional con lo cual la ciudadanía peruana toda de la que formo parte resultó agraviada en su derecho contar con funcionarios del banco central de reserva constitucional legal reglamentariamente elegidos por ende los 3 ciudadanos que de este modo vedado resultaron electos josé chlimper ackerman rafael rey rey elmer rafael cuba bustinza frente una proposición de keiko fujimori con fraude procesal son ilegítimos 2 derecho al voto congresal válido con apego constitución política ley orgánica del banco central de reserva reglamento del congreso como se sabe la elección de los 3 miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva fue por 84 votos la de elmer cuba por 72 la de josé chlimper por 71 la de rafael rey ningún guarismo de esa votación puede considerarse válido legítimo porque ninguno de los votantes tenía la información documental que oficialmente se debería haber presentado distribuido cada uno de los parlamentarios examinada como fundamento de su voto la propia misteriosa proposición de dos candidaturas por keiko fujimori sabemos que apareja ningún documento de los candidatos pese que la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva en su artículo 11 exige como requisitos de los que aspiren ser miembros del directorio del banco tener reconocida solvencia moral una amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas se trata de elementos reales de hechos que deben probarse con documentos indubitables que el votante tiene que tener ante sí para analizar contrastar evaluar decidir su voto con apego derecho sin falsear su decisión través del voto informado por intereses vitandos que agreden al país reza el violado desacatado al votar inválidamente artículo 11 de la citada ley orgánica los directores deben ser peruanos tener reconocida solvencia moral poseer amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas no representan entidad interés particular alguno su voto debe tener en cuenta únicamente el cumplimiento de la finalidad las funciones del banco si todos los congresistas votantes nunca vieron dentro del llevado cabo procedimiento especial parlamentario al que hemos antes glosado ningún documento de los 3 propuestos 2 por keiko otro dizque por el apra ni hubo debate alguno el cual se obvió adrede respecto de sus calidades personales profesionales el voto que emitieron fue ciego inducido por el mentado fraude sin deliberación mental alguna al carecer de elementos de juicio objetivos reales sobre esa reconocida solvencia moral la necesaria amplia competencia además la amplia experiencia que deben favorecer cada uno de los propuestos para un voto aprobatorio válidamente emitido si los hechosrequisitos su prueba concomitante están ante sí del congresista votante su voto resulta viciado por ende ilegítimo nulo 3 derecho la transparencia de los actos del estado que garantice el acceso la información pública todo indica que nada en este procedimiento parlamentario de elección de estos 3 directores del bcrp fue transparente todo fue turbio de principio fin con un clarísimo fraude procesal iniciado por la demandada keiko fujimori tanto la repentina proposición fraudulenta hecha por keiko fujimori el día 26102016 un día antes de la elección sin que se sepa hasta hoy cómo fue ante una junta de portavoces que recibió ni vio los currículum vitae de los propuestos así como la aluvional votación llevada cabo el día siguiente el jueves 27102016 sin examinar ningún documento acerca de los requisitos que la ley exige los candidatos sin el debate que el artículo 64 del reglamento del congreso requiere para esta elección específica en un procedimiento parlamentario especial en relación las calidades personales profesionales de los 3 futuros miembros del directorio del banco central de reserva reviste la obligatoria transparencia que deben adornar los actos del estado como éste del congreso que prevé regula la ley 27806 ley de transparencia fin de garantizar el derecho fundamental del acceso la información que consagra el numeral 5 del artículo 2 de la constitución política cuando los actos estatales realizados en todo el procedimiento especializado parlamentario en cuestión son transparentes como en efecto lo han sido el derecho fundamental la información pública resulta vulnerado lo cual debe ser reparado fue la bravura de una bravísima keiko su audacia un interés nefando que la llevó proponer con fraude miembros del bcrp por lo menos se sabe que fue keiko fujimori quien propuso oralmente por escrito su secretario general de su partido político josé chlimper su ocasional asesor elmer cuba como directores del bcrp ambos activistas de su campaña electoral presidencial última ninguno de los 72 congresistas suyos chistó rechistó ni hizo amago de mueca alguna todos doblegaron la cerviz designaron de un día otro mediante su voto los propuestos sin trámite ni debate alguno ciegamente sin examen de requisitos legales sin tener la vista semejantes candidatos ni siquiera oírlos porque tenían una premura inusitada tiene una persona particular como keiko fujimori lideresa de una agrupación partidaria el derecho de proponer con efectos legales e inmediatos en un procedimiento especial parlamentario sin ser congresista directores del citado banco nada menos que al secretario general de su partido fuerza popular otro activista de su reciente campaña electoral presidencial serán los propuestos de contundente actuación político partidaria las personas independientes que contribuyan la autonomía que requiere el bcrp sin poner en riesgo la confidencialidad de una sana política bancaria monetaria en particular lo confiesa alegremente que ella fue la que propuso estos 2 candidatos su atento comedido lugarteniente congresista miguel torres morales hijo de un antiguo fujimorista ultramontano carlos torres torres lara ya fallecido pero que dejó su heredero universal en el congreso precisamente al lado detrás de keiko su padre estuvo detrás de alberto hoy preso si esta proposición fraudulenta silenciosa nada transparente fue suficiente para que 72 votaran por ella significa que keiko fujimori maneja su antojo los 72 congresistas de su partido fuerza popular ora directamente por interpósita persona como lo hacía antes vladimiro montesinos torres hoy también preso en los años 90 además la proposición decisión adoptada viola el texto expreso del artículo 11 de la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva del perú inconstitucional ilegalidad delito producto ilegítimo la conducta es la pluralidad de actos realizados que exteriorizan una voluntad el producto es el resultado conseguido con esa conducta los congresistas mayormente fujimoristas que designaron josé chlimper rafael rey elmer cuba para integrar el directorio del banco central de reserva del perú bcrp violaron la constitución política las leyes orgánica de dicho banco de transparencia el reglamento del congreso de la república en la forma antes anotada cuando tales parlamentarios producen actos administrativos como es designar miembros del directorio del bcrp integrantes de otros organismos están obligados respetar las normas constitucionales las legales de todo tipo zurrarse en ellas sin incurrir en responsabilidad su designio es respetar las normas preexistentes la ley orgánica del banco central de reserva del perú en su artículo 11 obliga que se designe como miembros del directorio del banco quienes tienen reconocida solvencia moral además amplia competencia experiencia en economía finanzas requisitos que son hechos macizos que deben ser reales acreditados con los documentos respectivos el congresista que vota por

indicate race voter registration forms point toward considerable decline black turnout in georgia black share electorate fell 27 6 percent 29 9 percent louisiana fell 28 5 percent 30 1 percent according completed state turnout data the data yet final north carolina black share electorate looks unlikely reach 21 percent voters 23 percent 2012 the data even less complete florida appears black turnout fall similar amount perhaps 12 7 percent voters 14 percent in states black share electorate still poised higher 2004 it wasnt high mr obama top ticket young black voters appear key driver decline they registered lower rate ahead 2012 2008 presidential elections causing black share registered voters dip and registered turned far lower rate black registrants four years ago the data authoritative elsewhere country tells similar story turnout dropped 8 percent majority black wards philadelphia rising everywhere else city the turnout detroit fell 14 percent turnout fell industrial centers large black population like milwaukee flint mich its hard know much lower black turnout instead black population decline census struggle make population estimates places declining population turnout certainly dropped faster reported population decline taken totality appears black turnout dropped somewhere 5 percent 10 percent exceptions it noted decline black turnout appears consistent across country regardless whether states put new laws might reduce turnout like cutting early voting requiring photo id was decline black turnout enough change result election it seems if black turnout matched 2012 levels mrs clinton would almost certainly scratched wins wisconsin michigan pennsylvania florida north carolina would extremely close but pinning mrs clintons loss low black turnout would probably mistake mr obama would easily elections level black turnout support he would michigan ohio wisconsin time even detroit cleveland milwaukee severed states cast adrift great lakes perhaps important clinton campaigns models public polls assumed lower black turnout still showed mrs clinton track victory the clinton campaign believed could compensate loss obama coalition winning rising american electorate coalition ascendant voters hispanic voters caricature obama coalition these demographic shifts benefited democrats last decade gains come noncompetitive states this year exit polls exaggerated importance hispanic voters last time said voters election mr obama time lost mrs clinton according exit polls mrs clinton fared tad worse among white voters much worse among hispanic black voters mr obama and polls said didnt win white voters many polls indicated but preliminary upshot analysis voting returns census polling data suggests mrs clinton stronger among white nonwhite voters exit polls imply it important emphasize estimates preliminary they change next years data census bureau additional polling but nonetheless paints alternative picture thats consistent actual results polls consensus academics campaign analysts electorate the upshot estimates suggest mrs clinton really might become first democrat win white voters college degree although possible mr obama 2008 well mrs clintons gains concentrated among affluent white voters much mr trumps gains concentrated among white voters she gained 17 points among white postgraduates according upshot estimates four points among whites bachelors degree there similar pattern income over picked 24 points among white voters degree making 250 000 according exit polls made slight gains among making less 100 000 per year these gains helped win huge margins prosperous liberal bastions new economy like manhattan silicon valley washington seattle chicago boston there mrs clinton ran huge margins traditionally liberal enclaves stamped nearly every last wealthy precinct supported republicans scarsdale n y voted mrs clinton 57 points mr obamas win you could drive full 30 miles leafy suburbs northwest boston reaching town mr trump hit 20 percent vote she affluent suburbs seattle like mercer island bellevue issaquah around 50 points doubling mr obamas victory every republican enclave western connecticut like darien greenwich voted mrs clinton cases swinging 30 points direction every precinct winnetka glencoe ill went mrs clinton well her gains nearly impressive affluent republican suburbs like edging west kansas city mo houston north atlanta dallas columbus ohio south charlotte n c los angeles orange county mrs clinton didnt always win affluent republican enclaves made big gains but narrowness mrs clintons gains among voters helped concentrate support coasts prosperous safely republican sun belt it left short suburbs like around philadelphia detroit tampa fla far fewer workers postgraduate degree make 100 000 per year work finance science technology a similar divide may helped obscure whether mrs clinton improved among hispanic voters question addressed depth harry enten fivethirtyeight mrs clinton expected excel among hispanic voters mr trumps proposals deport undocumented workers plans build wall along southern border inflammatory comments mexican immigrants the polls generally showed mrs clinton poised make good possibility but exit polls show marked decrease democratic strength mrs clinton winning 66 percent hispanic vote mr obamas 71 percent 2012 mrs clinton plainly fared worse mr obama many heavily hispanic areas like south texas south colorado our estimates suggest mrs clinton mr obama among hispanic voters the estimates hint potential explanation results heavily hispanic areas mrs clinton may faltered among hispanic voters without high school degree making gains among college education better nationwide mrs clintons success

futility moreover apart overlooking zionists acts hostility morriss claim arabs started war serves remove mutual hostilities broke wake general assemblys adoption resolution 181 larger contextand within larger context proper assessment side bore greater responsibility war made as example morris tends portray jewish violence arabs always preceded arab violence jewseven though illustrated equally true arab violence turn preceded jewish violence elsewhere contrast characterizes arab violence morris describes unambiguous war crimes committed zionist forces merely mistakes included among haganahs mistakes attack december 18 1947 village khisas carried approval yigal allon commander palmach elite unit within jewish army zionist forces invaded village indiscriminately murdered seven men woman four children morris describes reprisal murder jewish cart driver earlier day even though superfluously notes none dead appear involved death cart driver 21 another haganahs mistakes occurred night january 5 1948 zionist forces entered west jerusalem neighborhood katamon bombed semiramis hotel killing twentysix civilians including government official spain the explosion triggered start panic exodus prosperous arab neighborhood the british furious bengurion subsequently removed officer responsible command 22 palestinian refugees 1948 war source haniniorg cc by 30 but generally morris continues haganah retaliatory strikes december 1947march 1948 accurately directed either perpetrators home basesmeaning arab villages lived thus according morriss criteria haganah attacked arab village happened home one combatants proceeded go accurately killing innocent civilians destroying homes means mistake instructively morris quotes document intelligence wing haganah consequences describes jewish reprisals occurred months the main effect operations arab civilian population emphasis added haganah noted including destruction houses psychological trauma among consequences the jewish attacks forced arabs tie great forces protecting emphasis added 23 thus morriss characterization arabs aggressors haganah defensive throughout period contradicted account citing primary source evidence precisely opposite true indeed morris goes considerable detail documenting summation yishuv organized war the arabs hadnt 24 morriss characterization arabs always aggressors jews defensive despite occasional mistakes noted extends well prior onset 1948 war while lehis murder five members shubaki family november 20 seems fit morriss criteria mistake could turn also point arab attacks jews occurred well prior incident he writes example spring summer 1939 irgun zvai leumi formed activist breakaways haganah subjected arab towns unnerving campaign retaliatory terrorism special haganah units adding bloodshed selective reprisals emphasis added 25 once see morris doesnt try justify acts terrorism characterize occurring retaliation earlier acts aggression arabs indeed morris could go back decade prior within exercise trying pinpoint responsibility initiation titfortat violence point 1929 massacre jews hebron may 1921 arab mobs murdered jews jaffa still april 1920 arab rioters killed five jews jerusalem there dispute earlier incidences violence initiated arabs but question remains occurred did murderous attacks reflect inherent hatred jews among arab population or context debate morris critics still missing the rejection palestinian selfdetermination the struggle palestine roots arabisraeli conflict jeremy r hammond an overview crucial period rise zionist movement creation state israel order now learn more those questions british occupiers asked conducted inquiries try answer the inquiry outbreak violence 1921 haycraft commission determined inherent antisemitism country racial religious we credibly assured educated arabs would welcome arrival welltodo able jews could help develop country advantage sections community 26 the outbreaks rather reflected growing apprehension resentment among arabs toward zionist project reconstitute palestine jewish stateand displace otherwise disenfranchise lands majority arab population nor arabs fears unfounded indeed zionists quite open intentions when acting chairman zionist commission interviewed example perfectly frank expressing view zionist ideal in opinion one national home palestine jewish one equality partnership jews arabs jewish predominance soon numbers race sufficiently increased 27 the shaw commission inquiring cause 1929 violence arrived conclusion observed in less ten years three serious attacks made arabs jews for eighty years first attacks recorded instance similar incidents it obvious relations two races past decade must differed material respect previously obtained of found ample evidence the reports military court local commission 1920 1921 respectively enquired disturbances years drew attention change attitude arab population towards jews palestine this borne evidence tendered enquiry representatives parties told us war jews arabs lived side side amity least tolerance quality today almost unknown palestine 28 morris likewise notes 1948 attacks chiefly

moreover incentives register including desire avoid granting legitimacy ottoman government avoid paying registration fees taxes evade possible military conscription additionally land lived cultivated

percent land palestine arabs owned land jews every single district including jaffa included largest jewish population center tel aviv according unscop report the arab population despite strenuous

report stated obviously intention make possible creation jewish national home actually may well said jewish national home sui generis mandate palestine run counter principle 56 given proper historical context return benny morriss argument palestinians ones started war rejected un compromise plan embarked hostile acts this argument assumes arabs rejection plan somehow unreasonable it morriss argument also assumes resolution 181 somehow lent legitimacy zionists goal establishing jewish state palestine within area proposed unscops plan it while popular myth un created israel partition plan actually never implemented resolution 181 merely recommended palestine partitioned referred matter security council died needless say neither general assembly security council authority partition palestine majority inhabitants although resolution 181 cited israels founding document granted legitimacy establishment jewish state truth resolution neither partitioned palestine conferred legal authority zionists unilateral declaration existence state israel may 14 1948 57 when morris says arabs states declared intent attack jewish state british left really means therefore declared intent take arms prevent zionists unilaterally declaring sovereignty lands rights politically disenfranchising majority population palestine morris employs rhetorical devicea mainstay zionist propagandain book 1948 suggest arabs aggressors jews simply defending for example emphasizes fighting november 1947 midmay 1948 occurred areas earmarked jewish statehoodthus implying fighting occurred land rightfully belonging jews however fact violence occurred within area completely irrelevant tells us nothing side guilty aggression after arabs owned land jews much fighting took place arab villages towns located within earmarked territory it largely basis assumption land proposed jewish state partition plan indeed rightfully jews sustain narrative from end november 1947 end march 1948 arabs held initiative haganah strategic defensive 58 going civil war haganah policy purely defensive morris repeatsalthough grants mainstream zionist leaders first began think expanding jewish state beyond 29 november partition resolution borders defensive policy early months war dictated part lack means yet ready largescale offensive operations 59 but arabs initiated violence morriss account haganah acted selfdefense occasionally retaliating arab traffic villages urban neighborhoods 60 ilan pappé sheds additional light haganahs defensive operations undertaken the first step wellorchestrated campaign

morris took place edges main townsjerusalem tel avivjaffa haifa most violence initiated arabs arab snipers continuously fired jewish houses pedestrians traffic planted bombs mines along urban rural

arab neighbourhoods could easily shell snipe they started frequently since early december they used methods intimidation well jewish troops rolled barrels full explosives huge steel balls arab

december onwards siege intimidation but worse come 64 haifa ethnic cleansing source palestinerememberedcom plan d morriss debate critics centers largely around plan d dalet fourth letter hebrew alphabet in contrast describes zionists defensive stage war plan d marked account beginning war conquest 65 morris correct plan d explicitly call expelling many arabs possible territory future jewish state blatman suggests but neither order neutral friendly villages left untouched morris contends under plan d brigade commanders use discretion mounting operations enemy population centersmeaning arab towns villagesby choosing following options destruction villages setting fire blowing planting mines debris especially population centers difficult control continuously mounting combing control operations according following guidelines encirclement village conducting search inside in event resistance armed force must wiped population must expelled outside borders state 66 thus plan d allowed arab inhabitants remain long resist takeover villages zionist forces order haganah commanders permit stay circumstancesas morris falsely suggests second responses haaretz nor morris incognizant critical distinction in 1948 explicitly notes brigade commanders given option destroying arab villages emphasis addedwhich would obviously necessitate expelling inhabitantsregardless whether villagers offered resistance the commanders given discretion whether evict inhabitants villages urban neighborhoods sitting vital access roads morris writes emphasis added the plan gave brigades carte blanche conquer arab villages effect decide villages fate emphasis addeddestruction expulsion occupation the plan explicitly called destruction resisting arab villages expulsion inhabitants 67 as ilan pappé expounds villages expelled entirety either located strategic spots expected put sort resistance these orders issued clear occupation would always provoke resistance therefore village would immune either location would allow occupied 68 by means time war ended zionist forces expelled inhabitants destroyed 531 villages emptied eleven urban neighborhoods arab residents 69 pappé notes facts ground

majority jews danger addition beginning december 1947 end march 1948 army able complete first stage cleansing palestine even master plan put effect if turning point april shift sporadic attacks counterattacks palestinian civilian population towards systematic megaoperation ethnic cleansing followed 70 in haaretz morris adds larger urban areas mixed populations plan d orders arabs transferred arab centers cities like haifa expelled country morris also writes zionists left arabs place haifa cites example place arabs ordered encouraged leaders fleeas opposed expelled zionist forces but details morris provides 1948 happened haifa tell altogether different story by end march 1948 wealthy middleclass families fled haifa far ordering evacuation arab leadership blasted fled cowards tried prevent leaving 71 among reasons flight terrorist attacks irgun sowed panic haifa cities on morning december 30 1947 example irgun threw three bombs passing van crowd casual arab laborers bus stop outside haifa oil refinery killing eleven wounding dozens 72 ilan pappé notes throwing bombs arab crowds specialty irgun already done 1947 73 and morris points arab militias took note methods irgun lehi eventually started copying the arabs noted devastating effects wellplaced jewish bombs jerusalem jaffa haifa 74 arab laborers inside plant responded turning jewish coworkers killing thirtynine wounding fifty several arab employees try protect jewish coworkers 75 the haganah retaliated targeted nearby village home many refinery workers the orders spare women children kill men the raiders

morris attributed flight solely orders arab leadership leave city 1948 notes factors included psychological trauma violenceespecially haganahs mortaring lower cityand despair thought living minority people inflicted collective punishment upon furthermore the jewish authorities almost immediately grasped city without large actively potentially hostile arab minority would better emergent jewish state militarily politically moreover days 22 april haganah units systematically swept conquered neighborhoods arms irregulars often handled population roughly families evicted temporarily homes young males arrested beaten the haganah troops broke arab shops storage facilities confiscated cars food stocks looting rife 83 this situation morris describing disingenuously writes haaretz zionist forces left arabs place haifa arabs fled haifa ordered encouraged leaders we also compare morriss account village lifta came emptied arab inhabitants ilan pappés 1984 contains one mention lifta single sentence morris characterizes another example arabs fled upon orders leadership for example already 34 december 1947 inhabitants lifta village western edge jerusalem ordered send away women children partly order make room incoming militiamen 84 pappé tells remarkably different story describing lifta population 2500 one first ethnically cleansed social life lifta revolved around small shipping centre included club two coffee houses it attracted jerusalemites well doubt would today still one coffee houses target hagana attacked 28 december 1947 armed machine guns jews sprayed coffee house

avoid harm leave women children 95 morriss denial events describes constituted ethnic cleansing seems difficult reconcile allons statement goal palmachs operations galilee cleanse area arab inhabitants in 2004 interview ari shavit morris also noted respect use verb cleanse describe happened throughout palestine i know doesnt sound nice thats term used time i adopted 1948 documents i immersed indeed morris used term repeatedly discussion shavit morris expressed view cleansing palestine morally justified bengurion right if done state would come that clear it impossible evade without uprooting palestinians jewish state would arisen there justification acts rape there justification acts massacre those war crimes but certain conditions expulsion war crime i dont think expulsions 1948 war crimes you cant make omelet without breaking eggs you dirty hands there circumstances history justify ethnic cleansing i know term completely negative discourse 21st century choice ethnic cleansing genocidethe annihilation peoplei prefer ethnic cleansing that situation that zionism faced a jewish state would come without uprooting 700000 palestinians therefore necessary uproot there choice expel population i feel sympathy palestinian people truly underwent hard tragedy i feel sympathy refugees but desire establish jewish state legitimate choice but i identify bengurion i think made serious historical mistake 1948 even though understood demographic issue need establish jewish state without large arab minority got cold feet war in end faltered if already engaged expulsion maybe done complete job if end story turns gloomy one jews bengurion complete transfer 1948 because left large volatile demographic reserve west bank gaza within israel the noncompletion transfer mistake 96 morriss recent denial occurred ethnic cleansing also difficult reconcile earlier comments indeed would seem quite impossible presumably morris made attempt steven klein contribution debate pointed words morriss arab refugees crowding british ship carrying acre april 1948 life magazine source palestinerememberedcom the fallacies morriss arguments now proper historical context established lets return morriss arguments address turn morris denies jewish leadership carried policy expelling local arabs this denial untenable logically goal establishing demographically jewish state would require compulsory transferto borrow bengurions phrase turn borrowed peel commissionof large number arabs bengurion zionist leaders explicitly stated desire effect transfer war broke clear tacit understanding political leadership military commanders toward end as morris pointed atmosphere transfer commanders carried expulsions punished moreover midmarch onward commanders given explicit instructions compulsory transfer carried if expulsion arab villagers prior plan d received tacit approval leadership expulsions thereafter received explicit approval commanders like yigal allon understood orders well imperative cleanse areas operation arab inhabitants after blatman cited morris support assertion palestine ethnically cleansed 1948 morris accused blatman attributing things never claimed yet morris previously described happened war ethnic cleansingand expressed view bengurions error thorough enough job morris argues blatmans assertion ignores basic fact palestinians ones started war even accept assumptions arabs rejection un partition plan unreasonable responsible starting war follow ethnic cleansing occurred in keeping comments ari shavit morris really seems arguing didnt happen justified palestine wasnt actually ethnically cleansedclearly account wasjust view wasnt crime and legal scholars may debate whether actions prohibited laws war time isnt ambiguity fact recognized today war crimesand regardless international treaties say immoral would today moreover morriss assumptions un partition plan equitable solution resolution 181 lent legitimacy zionists unilateral declaration existence state israel may 14 1948 categorically false he bases arguments jews acting defensively grounds arab states threatened attack jewish state carried threat invading israel but given illegitimacy may 14 declaration inherent prejudice zionist project toward majority arab population narrative crumbles to characterize arabs invaders palestines arab inhabitants systematically expelled driven flight arab villages literally wiped map simply flip reality head morris denies ever decision jewish leadership expel arabs he repeats bengurion never gave officers order expel arabs it might true known documents including plan d contained exact words leaderships intent clear indeed sentence says bengurion gave order morris notes bengurion let officers understand preferable arabs possible remain new country his implied logic without explicit order wasnt ethnic cleansing this non sequitur no explicit order need given enough haganah commanders understood leaderships intention arabs possible quote morriss words jewish state seeking establish palestinian refugees fleeing homes october 30 1948 source palestinerememberedcom moreover plan d make explicit operational orders expel arabs villages morris also suggests since arabs expelled therefore wasnt ethnic cleansing but logic non sequitur it doesnt follow since arabs allowed remain territory became israel therefore expulsion majority territorys arab inhabitants didnt constitute ethnic cleansing morris opine bengurion didnt thorough enough job cant sustain suggestion lack thoroughness means wasnt ethnic cleansing the atmosphere transfer acknowledged morris yet asserts zionist leaders like bengurion weizmann supported transfer arabs 1930s early 40s later supported un decision whose plan left 400000 arabs place with comment implies bengurion leaders changed minds decided population 400000 arabs within area desired jewish state would fine once argument non sequitur acceptance partition plan constitute repudiation desire rid land arabs on contrary seen pragmatic step toward achieving ultimate goal establishing jewish state less arabs golda meir indeed acknowledges atmosphere transfer still prevailed april 1948 argues never translated official policywhich officers expelled arabs others didnt but fact arabsabout 160000 according morriswere permitted remain mean rest werent victims ethnic cleansing once explicit orders expel arabs neednt existed us recognize occurred ethnic cleansing enough tacit understanding existed political leadership military commanders morris acknowledges fact caseincluding pointing commanders expelled arabs villages werent punished moreover atmosphere transfer translated official policy plan d on march 24 1948 morris argues haaretz israel galili ordered haganah brigades uproot arabs territory designated jewish state in 1948 specifies galili instructed haganah units abide standing zionist policy respect rights needs freedom without discrimination arabs living jewish state areas 97 how morris reconcile explicit orders plan d collectively punish civilian population expelling homes destroying villages how reconcile fact account commanders expelled arabs destroyed villages werent punished defying morris characterizes direct order instructively makes attempt but note things change early april meaning ostensible order respect rights palestinian civilians rescinded as notes 1948 policy outlined april generally evict arabs living brigades area 98 so morris light admission maintain overall expulsion policy he notes expelled people didnt part arabs simply fled but neither fact arabs allowed remain many fled fear inconsistent recognition happened ethnic cleansing finally morris acknowledges zionist leadership matter policy prevented palestinian refugees returning homes indeed made largely impossible complete destruction villages he makes effort reconcile policy denial ethnic cleansing occurred instead opines policy logical we see thus morris isnt much arguing ethnic cleansing ethnic cleansing justified he attempting argue ethnic cleansing occurwhich explicitly acknowledged occur documents extensively writingswas crime benny morris entitled opinions but deny jewish state israel established ethnically cleansing hundreds thousands arabs homes palestine simply display intellectual dishonesty accuses critics the standard applies telling defends ethnic cleansing grounds arabs made refugees war israel refused allow return tried destroy state making inasmuch inhabitancy land zionist leadership desired jewish state stood way project point their existence land constituted destruction zionists ideal hence go in morriss words a jewish state would come without uprooting 700000 palestinians therefore necessary uproot beyond morriss hypocrisy glaring he knows perfectly well expelled civilians taken part hostilities hence really saying logical civilian arab population

              " 'в ноябре 2016 г мажилис парламента республики казахстан одобрил создание на территории страны банка низкообогащенного урана магатэ низкообогащенный уран ноу это материал из которого делается топливо для аэс создать стратегическое хранилище ноу международное атомное агентство решило еще в 2006 г цель проекта гарантировать бесперебойные поставки топлива на аэс стран входящих в магатэ при этом из самого банка регулярных поставок осуществляться не будет это будет неприкосновенный запас которым не будут пользоваться без чрезвычайной ситуации официально запасы ноу будут принадлежать магатэ разместить банк было решено на территории одного из членов агентства оператором могло стать государство не имеющее ядерного оружия но при этом обладающее технологиями и инфраструктурой для работы с ноу кроме того страна должна была обладать хорошей репутацией в магатэ казахстан удовлетворял всем этим условиям как известно рк крупнейший производитель урана с соответствующими технологиями и опытом в том числе по переработке высокообогащенного урана в ноу что важно для ядерного разоружения страна решила поучаствовать в развитии мирного атома и летом 2011 г подала в магатэ заявку для размещения банка казахстан предложил два места участок на бывшем семипалатинском полигоне и ульбинский металлургический завод г устькаменогорск после проверки обоих участков экспертами агентства был выбран второй вариант ульбинский металлургический завод имеет почти полувековой опыт с радиоактивными материалами и компетентных специалистов наследников советской школы кроме того предприятие прошло серьезную модернизацию и отвечает самым высоким требованиям безопасности в апреле 2015 г вышло постановление правительства рк одобряющее договор с магатэ о создании банка ноу в казахстане в августе 2015 г этот договор был подписан министром иностранных дел рк ерланом идрисовым и генеральным директором магатэ юкия амано сейчас полным ходом идут подготовительные работы в которых участвуют эксперты магатэ прежде чем банк ноу будет размещен на казахской земле правительству рк еще придется доработать как инфраструктуру так и законодательство чтобы все соответствовало международным критериям безопасности начало уже положено так в январе 2016 г был принят закон об использовании атомной энергии в составлении некоторых дополнений к новому закону участвовали эксперты магатэ предстоит еще многое сделать чтобы новое хранилище было максимально безопасно для местного населения и окружающей среды весь материал будет содержаться в контейнерах соответствующих европейским стандартам по данным магатэ урана в хранилище хватит чтобы обеспечивать электричеством крупный город в течение 3 лет все расходы связанные с перевозкой урана уплатой налогов и гарантиями по отношению к банку ноу магатэ берет на себя казахстану предстоит за свой счет эксплуатировать хранилище обеспечивать его электроэнергией платить заработную плату работникам гражданам рк и тп в благодарность за размещение и содержание на своей территории банка ноу казахстан рассчитывает на помощь магатэ в развитии своей атомной промышленности уже сейчас на территории рк работает комиссия магатэ проводящая общее исследование ядерной инфраструктуры по окончании своей работы комиссия подготовит отчет с рекомендациями по развитию казахстанской атомной промышленности республика обладает огромными запасами урана и занимает первое место в мире по его добыче казахстанская продукция занимает немалую часть мирового уранового рынка при этом казахстан давно мечтает не только поставлять другим странам сырье или полуфабрикаты но и самостоятельно проводить все этапы ядерного топливного цикла до превращения урана в готовое топливо для аэс несомненно экспортировать готовый продукт гораздо прибыльнее об этой задаче напомнил президент рк нурсултан назарбаев во время встречи с председателем правления казатомпрома аскаром жумагалиевым состоявшейся в начале ноября 2016 г тогда он отметил что для достижения своей цели казахстан должен усилить сотрудничество в атомной сфере с другими странами и международными организациями следует напомнить что одним из основных партнеров казахстана в атомной сфере является россия благодаря работе с россией рк значительно продвинулась на пути к самостоятельному производству ядерного топлива сотрудничество продолжается в октябре 2016 г в астане состоялся форум межрегионального сотрудничества россии и казахстана в котором участвовали президенты двух стран владимир путин и нурсултан назарбаев в результате россия и казахстан приняли план совместных действий до 2018 г и подписали меморандум о расширении стратегического сотрудничества в области ядернотопливного цикла меморандум подтверждает все прежние договоренности между двумя странами касающиеся совместной работы в области аэ в том числе добычи и переработки урана помимо прочего в документе упоминается возможность совместного участия россии и казахстана в проектах магатэ размещение на территории республики банка ноу широкий жест в сторону магатэ который поднимет авторитет казахстана в глазах других государств создание хранилища ноу не только подстрахует работающие ядерные реакторы от дефицита топлива но и поспособствует нераспространению ядерного оружия дело в том что сейчас страны желающие освоить мирный атом часто вынуждены самостоятельно обогащать уран чтобы превратить его в топливо при этом магатэ беспокоит что ктото из них может превысить необходимый для мирных целей уровень обогащения и получить материал для создания ядерного оружия появление хранилища ноу в которое может обратиться любая страначлен магатэ позволит им не заниматься обогащением урана самостоятельно тем самым снизив угрозу распространения ядерного оружия таким образом казахстан может стать стратегически важным членом магатэ участвующим в обеспечении мировой безопасности помимо престижа и помощи в атомных проектах это может привлечь к стране внимание зарубежных инвесторов по данным правительства рк за первую половину 2016 г объем иностранных инвестиций в экономику страны увеличился в 5 раз составив почти 6 млрд долларов сша такой рост несомненно связан с ростом международного авторитета казахстана которым он отчасти обязан своему сотрудничеству с магатэ дмитрий бокарев политический обозреватель специально для интернетжурнала новое восточное обозрение популярные статьи',\n",

colleagues ladies gentlemen i confident members valdai club actively take part work your expertise enables understand angles processes underway russia world forecast evaluate longterm trends put forward new initiatives recommendations help us find way prosperous sustainable future badly need thank much attention comments end vladimir putin i would like make quick response mr fischer said he mentioned discussions eu trade agreement canada this internal eu matter permit i would like make one small remark i know europe find wallonias position irritating region home 35 million people 35 million people blocking decision issue global importance namely trade agreement canada but belgium took part eus creation basis particular principles including belgium overall wallonia would certain rights the eu grown greatly since much different membership rules changed perhaps rules need changed case would first give people created organisation chance change democratic process obtain approval as dispute i familiar details europeans course whatever prerogatives eu supranational bodies note i already spoken publicly point european parliament adopts far greater number binding decisions regard member states ussr supreme soviet regard soviet unions constituent republics soviet period it us say whether good bad we want see strong centralised europe this position but europe many different views i hope whole issue resolved positive fashion on matter un i said say must return written un charter universal organisation world if renounce un sure road chaos there universal alternative world yes world changed yes un security council need reform reconstruction but say foreign ministry way preserve organisations effectiveness we basis broad consensus we need ensure vast majority international actors give support reforms today must return common understanding principles international law enshrined un charter this un established world war ii particular balance power world later collapse soviet union united states decided one coordinate things really need get anyones approval fundamental matters this start everything first 1990s airstrikes belgrade i go humanitarian aspect preceded decisions seeing airstrikes carried heart europe end twentieth century seemed simply barbaric this done violation un charter without approval when happened people immediately started saying old rules outdated something change things got worse events iraq did un sanction operations iraq no before operations afghanistan 2001 yes know tragedy september 11 2001 even existing international law relevant un security council resolution sought first done then came iraq came resolution libya you experts read resolution libya know establishing nofly zone but kind nofly zone speak airstrikes began libyan territory this flagrant violation un charter and came syria it either tarja heinz said operations aleppo increasing number terrorists but terrorist ranks start swelling aleppo were terrorists iraq there terrorists countrys state structures destroyed the true libya terrorists but soon countrys statehood destroyed came along fill vacuum terrorists the happening syria i understand insinuations made action aleppo elsewhere but lets remember soon conflict began syria began long became involved terrorists appeared began receiving arms supplies i mentioned opening remarks attempts made train terrorists set alassad options groups effective this continues today effective fighting units think possible make use sort later but illusion it wont work problem i would also like respond absolutely proper developments finland instance bells tolling killed aleppo bells also tolling losing lives mosul vicinity the operation mosul getting underway as far i know terrorists already shot 200 people hope stopping offensive town lets forget and afghanistan whole wedding parties 120 people wiped single airstrike a single strike have forgotten and whats happening yemen let bells toll innocent victims i agree we keep hearing aleppo aleppo aleppo but issue do leave nest terrorists place squeeze best minimise avoid civilian casualties if better go offensive mosul shouldnt go ahead either lets leave everything lets leave raqqa alone our partners keep saying we need take back raqqa eliminate nest terrorists but civilians raqqa so fight terrorists and take hostages towns leave look israels example israel never steps back always fights end survives there alternative we need fight if keep retreating always lose regarding tarja said subject security baltic sea area i remind matter came initiative visit naantali finland initiative mr niinisto president finland quite blue requested russian aircraft fly transponders for familiar military matters i note transponders instruments signal aircrafts location air of course aircraft fly transponders increases security baltic sea region this truth matter i responded immediately noting firstly far flights nato aircraft region aircraft secondly i promised finnish president would definitely raise issue partners next russianato council meeting i tell the result nato partners rejected putins proposal said but nothing putin they rejected proposal made mr niinisto president finland this straightforward matter us either i would say technical dimension involved purely military dimension but i give defence ministry instructions find way without detriment security the defence ministry found solution nato colleagues rejected so please direct questions nato headquarters brussels vladimir putin i think intervention country another countrys internal political process unacceptable matter attempts made help cyberattacks instruments organisations controlled outside within country you know happened turkey example position taken president turkey recep erdogan he believes coup attempt turkey undertaken groups inspired direct help organisation run certain gulen lived united states last 9 years this unacceptable cyberattacks unacceptable but probably cannot avoid impact including cyberspace your question specific matter electoral system though i think absolutely unacceptable how avoid sort thing happen i think way reach agreement come rules common understanding recognised government state level verified of course issue internet freedom everything related arises know many countries including support internet freedom take practical steps restrict access concern peoples interests this concerns cybercrime example attacks banking systems illegal money transfers it concerns suicides crimes children forth these measures taken national level we take appropriate measures national level intergovernmental level vladimir putin on question favourites us presidential campaign said media created view yes case chance in observation rare occasion mass media forms view purely chance i think idea inserted public consciousness middle us presidential campaign pursues sole aim supporting defending interests ms clinton democratic party candidate fight republican party candidate case donald trump how done first create enemy form russia say trump preferred candidate this complete nonsense totally absurd its tactic domestic political struggle way manipulating public opinion elections take place as i said many times know exactly expect either candidates win we know mr trump would wins know ms clinton would would go ahead go ahead overall really matter us wins of course welcome public words willingness normalize relations two countries in sense yes welcome statements matter makes that i say really as mr trump chosen method reaching voters hearts yes behaves extravagantly course see but i think sense actions i say view represents interests sizeable part american society tired elites power decades he simply representing ordinary peoples interests he portrays ordinary guy criticizes power decades like see power handed inheritance example we read analysis including american analysis some experts written openly he operates niche the elections soon show whether effective strategy as i cannot repeat i said already work whichever president american people choose wants work us question mr president question follows subject security addressed obviously cooperation essential part realise cooperation always easy we saw example case transponders the planes still fly least but areas vital importance areas innocent peoples lives stake you mentioned recently case tsarnayev brothers as far i know russia passed information action taken does mean practical cooperation security critical situation vladimir putin i spoke matter meeting french journalists i recall correctly yes passed information tsarnayev brothers american partners we wrote received response after wrote second time got reply us citizens none business would take care everything i told director fsb archive file the response received still archives sadly months later boston marathon terrorist attack took place people killed it great shame tragedy took place if contacts trust us partners better could avoided the americans came immediately following attack gave information possession but late people already lost lives this partly answers last question we know say want work us really say quite rightly essential us especially fight terrorism in sense welcome declare intentions as i also said past americans provided us real help preparations olympic games sochi example grateful our cooperation efficient site level intelligence service heads there good examples cooperation overall quite good situation area european partners we open professional contacts french intelligence services example exchange information in general situation bad could lot better sabine fischer there discussion sending policing mission donbass also emphasis roadmap saw russia example media political debate i think really case diverging interpretations results vladimir putin this secret i tell i might leave something put anyone difficult position interfere process as know minsk agreements i think experts read say black white thirty days signing minsk agreements ukraines rada must adopt resolution outlining geographical boundaries areas law special status unrecognised republics would become effective immediately because thing needed work description geographical boundaries that established law parliamentary resolution resolution finally adopted even past deadline so one would think law take effect immediately it passed i would like remind parliament ukraine the lawmakers voted coordinated unrecognised republics important sense view makes viable legislation key element political settlement but passing resolution ukraine parliament adopted amendment paragraph article 9 10 said law would take effect municipal elections areas that postponed laws enforcement i repeat opinion law absolutely key political resolution crisis southeastern ukraine moreover done without even consulting anyone least unrecognised republics we discussed actively year ago paris i insisted done done immediately part minsk agreements view key component but ukrainian president said possible everything ended dead end in situation everything could ended year ago paris mr steinmeier german foreign minister suddenly proposed compromise he suggested agree law come force day local elections regions temporarily come force permanently osce office democratic institutions human rights recognises elections taken place accordance osce rules this set minsk agreements order get us deadlock i expressed agreement said would settle matter donetsk lugansk but berlin ukrainian president suddenly also attempted change proposal already result compromise he went even essentially renouncing laws implementation whatever case we thus found back crisis paris year but i want note federal chancellors role she found arguments persuade everyone present could keep agreement reached said possible change wed already agreed year later would never reach agreement but agreed bundle nuances details would implemented together concept spoke still worked that really but principle lot accomplished terms ensuring security we reached agreement nearly every point we made little progress humanitarian matters these regions remain tightly blockaded difficult situation but socalled civilised world prefers notice i want get debate matter as far normandy format goes whether useful simply alternative yes discussions proceed difficulty effective i agree option want make progress continue working format as question getting actors involved position opposed idea others taking part including american partners but reached agreement participants process work parallel american colleagues my aide ms nuland regular meetings discuss issues look compromise this done secret though course all participants normandy format meetings informed take account american partners position course angela stent this question president putin im angela stent im professor georgetown university washington mr president russia recently withdrew agreement united states dispose weaponsgrade plutonium time russian government said would consider rejoining agreement three conditions met firstly nato troops withdraw level 2000 europe secondly magnitsky act repealed thirdly sanctions imposed russia beginning ukraine crisis lifted russia paid compensation so question new president january 20 im optimistic are understand united states three conditions would form basis initial negotiating position russian part american president reestablishes highlevel relations kremlin thank vladimir putin one tell straight away academic diplomat if ask diplomats tell concept starting position as decision plutonium management disposition agreement withdraw the united states withdrew missile defence treaty withdraw plutonium agreement suspended why what agreements provisions under terms countries build facilities disposing surplus weaponsgrade plutonium accumulated russia usa not usa meet obligations agreement said would financial difficulties as russia financial difficulties built facility disposing plutonium using industrial methods without prior coordination us united states made unilateral announcement would dilute weaponsgrade plutonium would store beds forth this means retain experts call return potential words plutonium could returned reenriched moment but eliminating plutonium using industrial methods we built facility spent money are wealthier united states there many issues become difficult discuss current administration practically obligations met agreements respected including syria perhaps able come back we ready case talk new president look solutions even difficult issues question mr president question russian policy towards asia the emphasis today russian foreign policy construction multipolar world but also give thought importance multipolar asia both speech today general construction russian foreign policy points i think growing deepening contradictions us west one hand eurasian situation but also fact internal contradictions within eurasia the rise new powers creating lot fears breakdown old order parts releasing primordial forces these internal eurasia but danger russia emphasis multipolar world underestimating dangers unipolar asia need great powers work together construct genuinely democratic multipolar asia vladimir putin we actively developing relations asian countries tension relations europe united states simply life dictates choice why i say life dictates expand contacts the asian countries development influence growing continue whats growing fast with sizeable part territory asia russia would foolish make use geographical advantages develop ties neighbours china neighbour i mentioned opening remarks we longstanding good relations india would mistake make use develop solid longterm relations india today we many common interests we naturally complement politics economy as question multipolar unipolar asia see asia unipolar evident life diverse complex general full contradictions it important resolve contradictions civilised fashion i think asian countries leaders today sufficient common sense work way ready work way i visited india recently defence minister returned india we cooperation defence ministries also industry defence sector well civilian sector many common interests india china vietnam countries region these ties extensive promising thomas gomart in september 2014 valdai club described relations ukraine russia following sentence two countries one people today would describe relations two countries thank much vladimir putin i go blame i always considered still today russians ukrainians really one people there people hold radical nationalist views russia ukraine but overall majority one people people share common history culture ethnically close first divided set blame we must find way situation i sure common sense prevail find solution question mr president putting question i would like pass young students words two years ago came shanghai important business students missed chance meet university ask question asked tell would happy see time regardless whether retired my question follows we discussed philosophical matter international relations today humanity already gone different types international systems in view extent future systems resemble past ones what positive components emphasise particular should seek universality diversity far principles go what kind combination components would prefer see and i specific question we actively discussing relations russia west china vladimir putin heinz said philosophical question could spend long time discussing will tomorrows world resemble past no course how possible does todays china resemble china 1960s70s they two completely different countries soviet union gone today mr mbeki spoke africa i share arguments but africa cannot kind peripheral place if anyone thinks way deeply mistaken if follow kind thinking expect serious trials ahead we already hear talk refugees syria i saw today news latest incident mediterranean italian coastguard rescued refugees africa what syria got africas future worlds future serious issues the goes relations asia also many conflicts potential conflict situations i want repeat i said the question whether wisdom courage find acceptable solutions various problems complicated conflicts i certainly hope case world really become multipolar views actors international community taken account no matter whether country big small universally accepted common rules guarantee sovereignty peoples interests as relations partners europe united states america general asian countries multivector policy this virtue geographical location our policy regard partners built basis equality mutual respect alexei mukhin alexei mukhin centre political technology mr president ukraine constantly trying prohibit things russian we get impression everything russian squeezed ukrainian life in respect i philosophical question petro poroshenko said plans sell russian business interests does business actually exist what view vladimir putin we seek respect ownership rights mr kudrin staunch advocate property rights seeing one pillars economic policy i fully agree we always entirely successful area still improvements make much legislative work always keep working direction the concerns foreign investors including ukraine mr poroshenko one investors sense owner sizeable business lipetsk region roshen factory actually two businesses the second engaged selling products far i know there problems concerning nonreturn vat courts imposed restrictions factories operating paying wages earning profits restrictions using profits including transferring abroad i recall figures get detail i know business turning profit working success pyotr dutkevich pyotr dutkevich canada mr president i already put question yesterday deputy foreign minister i realise mistake person question really addressed my question follows we heard reports i know accurate discussed ceasefire syria meeting mr obama september i know accurate information seems 7day ceasefire proposed you expressed doubts said would possible separate radicals moderates short time task would likely prove impossible you given answer failed task would free hand can recall conversation it important history taking place syria vladimir putin yes i need recall i never forgot it important conversation there indeed talk lines russian syrian aircraft would cease airstrikes terrorist targets aleppo healthy opposition forces could separated forces jabhat alnusra terrorist organisation recognised united nations included list international terrorist organisations in respect i note secret american partners promised first recognised need second recognised part aleppo occupied terrorist organisations isis jabhat alnusra we see news reports see banners isis jabhat alnusra parts city they recognised needs done assured us would after agreed would decide right battlefield moderates would touch terrorists american partners would target terrorists they made repeated promises these promises made level defence ministers foreign ministers intelligence services unfortunately fell time keep promises the question raised meeting china yes american partner president obama indeed propose separating different forces but insisted must first declare dday cease hostilities stop airstrikes within 7 days would take responsibility separating moderates jabhat alnusra i go detail i think i right make details public after talks like always things say confidence but fact remains instead separating jabhat alnusra terrorists healthy opposition american partners broke ceasefire i originally insisted first separate terrorists moderates would end airstrikes end i decided agree american proposal talks they persistent i decided accept compromise said would go proposal declare ceasefire first stop airstrikes giving seven days asked the ceasefire declared september 12 i think 17th american aircraft carried strike syrian troops followed isis offensive we told strike mistake isis offensive coincidence perhaps ceasefire broken blame as us president promised didnt promise ask i imagine speak european partners goes europe i think done openly honestly simply attempt use influence position syria by way realise russian syrian aircraft carrying operations around aleppo 9 days we gave 7 days already 9 soon 10 days but effort separate terrorists moderates you realise meet obligations never succeed fight terrorism i realise easy task looking make accusations try keep promises in case end accused every possible sin this simply indecent we showing restraint respond partners insolence limit everything might reply point vladimir putin i turn tarja heinz know well osce works but i give opinion president poroshenko advanced initiative socalled policing mission duration possible future elections donbass donetsk lugansk i one supported it another matter i describe policing mission parties process objected they objected want help mr poroshenko osce never done anything like it experience people practice implementing policing missions at point parties process supported idea mr poroshenko advanced i however describe initiative policing mission opportunity responsible elections security campaign carry weapons those objected initiative pointed could provoke others use weapons armed people they believe power osce observers weapons fact represent respectable international organisation use weapons armed absolutely unacceptable seen least acceptable behaviour this power guns on hand mr poroshenko believes would help cause i agree however i one the situation strange issue i agree mr poroshenko i spoken nothing new ultimately parties agreed done careful consideration including osce i think never happened osce history if i wrong tarja correct what think tarja tcolton representative beijing please question thank just former president austria mr fischer said relationship eu russia expected 25 years ago its unfortunate hard optimistic so i want ask mr president point view and expectations assumptions 25 years ago wrong something go wrong along way and philosophical point view think lesson learned next 25 years vladimir putin what done correctly expectations high soviet union switched policy openness since ideological differences considered main cause division soviet union russia western world disappeared frankly soviet union gorbachev russia believed new life would begin us one experts rightly said things found run even deeper ideological differences namely national geopolitical interests could done things differently yes indeed during previous meeting room i said german politician mr rau wellknown figure social democratic party germany longer us used engage lively discussions soviet leaders back said conversations record cannot get around publishing need new international security system built europe in addition nato said imperative create another entity would include soviet union former warsaw pact countries participation united states order balance system he went say fail ultimately entire system created cold war would work soviet union he said bothers would unbalance entire system international relations security europe would jeopardised big way what old gentleman warned us time the people worked transforming world want change anything believed already riding high others political act absolutely correct ideas wise experienced german politician however i hope global alignment forces world changes political diplomatic regulatory support changes follow the world balanced multipolar place heinz fischer i also add 25 years ago early 90s and early 90s european union 12 members sweden finland austria joined 94 95 it sort honeymoon time russia europe particular russia germany russia important european countries it time economic crisis growth rates bigger it even time introduction euro euro important euro also accompanied problems look greece italy etc so factors also taken consideration thank tarja halonen i also add 25 years ago russia different european union different russia joined council europe quite long process i also involved so i think one lesson could perhaps learn also eu side council europe side good time make enlargement but perhaps fair invest enlargement process enlargement also afterwards perhaps process could easier today but know sometimes things hurried quite enough time but cannot take back past try build gabor stier my question president putin ukraine in past years often talked ukraine safety russian gas exports will ukrainian flats warm will kiev pay gas are talks gas exports ukraine underway was discussed ukrainian president berlin vladimir putin we concerned happening important energy component ukraine opinion opinion specialists worse ukrainian experts soviet times single complex realise going to guarantee uninterrupted supplies europe necessary pump required amount gas underground gas storage facilities this gas transit domestic consumption this technological gist done soviet times the amount gas facilities low its enough it necessary load 17 21 billion i think 14 billion loaded moreover already started syphon these grounds concern i discussed gas shipments ukraine ukrainian president initiative he wanted know whether russia could resume deliveries of course anytime nothing required we contract annex only one thing necessary advance payment we provide timely guaranteed energy supplies ukrainian consumers amount advance payment but today price ukraine agreed said last year higher price neighbours instance poland i know current prices conversation poland buying gas us 185 184 per thousand cubic metres accordance contractual commitments still valid we could sell gas ukraine 180 i mentioned price 180 per thousand cubic metres gas but told prefer reverse supplies by way violation gazproms contracts partners western europe turning blind eye showing understanding if prefer reverse supplies okay let get far i know cost gas end users industrial enterprises already topped 300 per thousand cubic metres we sell gas 180 want buy us yet i reason believe middlemen reverse deals close certain executives ukraines fuel energy complex good luck let importantly must guarantee transit european countries question i question inf treaty lot pressure today i sure aware lots bitter mutual recriminations in regard important understand russias general approach treaty does russia see value treaty yes exactly is even worthwhile part treaty vladimir putin it would great value us countries followed russia united states heres naive former russian leadership went ahead eliminated intermediaterange landbased missiles the americans eliminated pershing missiles scrapped ss20 missiles there tragic event associated chief designer systems committed suicide believing betrayal national interests unilateral disarmament why unilateral because treaty eliminated ground complex treaty include mediumrange sea airbased missiles air seabased missiles affected the soviet union simply united states kept service what ultimately got clear imbalance united states kept mediumrange missiles it matter whether based sea air land however soviet union simply left without type weapons almost neighbours make weapons including countries east borders middle eastern countries well whereas none countries sharing borders united states neither canada mexico manufacture weapons so us special test nevertheless believe necessary honour treaty all since may aware also mediumrange sea airbased missiles vladimir putin yes course i fully agree least try break vicious circle but first start drawing quite contrary opened completely mid1990s we expected equal dialogue interests would respected would discuss issues meet halfway it impossible offer unilateral solutions press towards goal costs you mentioned bombing former yugoslavia crimea thank example wonderful said the bombing belgrade intervention carried violation international law did un security council pass resolution military intervention yugoslavia no it unilateral decision united states now tell meant mentioned crimea what yugoslavia split several republics including kosovo separated states serbia in kosovo parliament voted secession end hostilities intervention thousands casualties but made decision accepted there hostilities crimea bombing raids casualties no one died the thing ensure free expression people way strict compliance un charter we almost kosovo in kosovo parliament approved secession resolution people crimea expressed opinion referendum after parliament ratified decision crimea independent state asked reintegrated russia of course keep exchanging caustic remarks i think vicious circle must broken i said i prepared say yugoslavia iraq libya afghanistan natos expansion and promises forgotten provoked protecting interests aggressive russia accused why provoking us taking action protect interests let us negotiate solutions instead but impossible agree anything and even agree something agreements implemented i would like different relations next us administration

              " 'russia cina e arabia saudita domano legemonia del dollaro di ariel noyola rodríguez gli stati uniti aumentano gli ostacoli tentando di mantenere legemonia del dollaro come valuta di riserva mondiale negli ultimi mesi paesi emergenti hanno venduto un molti buoni del tesoro degli usa principalmente russia e cina anche arabia saudita inoltre per proteggersi dalle violente fluttuazioni del dollaro le banche centrali di diversi paesi acquistano enormi quantità di oro per diversificare le riserve valutarie in breve loffensiva globale nei confronti del dollaro è esplosa attraverso la vendita massiccia di debito degli stati uniti e parallelo lacquisto colossale di metalli preziosi rete voltaire città del messico messico 5 novembre 2016 français español la supremazia di washington nel sistema finanziario globale ha subito un colpo tremendo ad agosto russia cina e arabia saudita vendevamo titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti per 379 miliardi di dollari secondo lultimo aggiornamento dei dati ufficiali pubblicato da pochi giorni 1 dal punto di vista generale gli investimenti globali nel debito pubblico degli stati uniti sono al livello minimo dal luglio 2012 chiaramente il ruolo del dollaro valuta di riserva mondiale è ancora messo discussione nel 2010 lammiraglio michael mullen presidente del joint chiefs staff statunitense avvertì che il debito era la principale minaccia alla sicurezza nazionale 2 a mio avviso non è tanto lalto debito pubblico oltre 19 000 miliardi 3 ad ostacolare leconomia degli stati uniti per washington è di fondamentale importanza garantirsi un enorme flusso di risorse estere ogni giorno per coprire deficit gemelli commercio e bilancio cioè per il dipartimento del tesoro è questione di vita di morte vendere titoli di debito nel mondo e così finanziare le spese degli usa si ricordi che dal fallimento di lehman brothers nel settembre 2008 bank china ha subito forti pressioni da ben bernanke allora presidente della federal reserve fed non vendere titoli del debito degli stati uniti in un primo momento cinesi decisero di mantenere il dollaro tuttavia da allora per due volte la pboc evitava di acquistare altri titoli degli stati uniti e allo stesso tempo avviava un piano per diversificare le riserve valutarie pechino acquista oro maniera massiccia negli ultimi anni e lo stesso fa la banca centrale della russia nel secondo trimestre del 2016 le riserve auree della banca di cina hanno raggiunto le 1 823 tonnellate contro le 1 762 tonnellate registrate nellultimo trimestre del 2015 la federazione russa ha aumentato le riserve auree di circa 290 tonnellate tra dicembre 2014 e giugno 2016 chiudendo il secondo trimestre di questanno con un totale di 1 500 tonnellate di fronte ai brutali scossoni del dollaro è fondamentale acquistare asset più sicuri come loro che tempi di grave instabilità finanziaria agisce da rifugio sicuro quindi la strategia di mosca e pechino nel vendere titoli del tesoro degli usa e comprare oro viene seguita da molti paesi come stimato dal fondo monetario internazionale fmi le riserve auree delle banche centrali nel mondo hanno già raggiunto il massimo degli ultimi 15 anni registrando ai primi di ottobre un volume di circa 33 000 tonnellate 4 la geopolitica fa la sua parte nel plasmare il nuovo ordine finanziario mondiale dopo limposizione delle sanzioni economiche al cremlino partire dal 2014 il rapporto con la cina ha avuto grande rilevanza per russi da allora le due potenze hanno approfondito legami tutti settori dalleconomia e finanza alla cooperazione militare inoltre assicurando la fornitura di gas alla cina per prossimi tre decenni il presidente vladimir putin ha costruito con lomologo xi jinping una potente alleanza finanziaria che cerca di porre fine una volta per tutte al dominio della moneta statunitense attualmente gli idrocarburi che mosca vende pechino sono pagati yuan non dollari così la moneta del popolo renminbi cinese emerge gradualmente nel mercato mondiale degli idrocarburi con il commercio tra russia e cina paesi che mio parere guidano la costruzione del sistema monetario multipolare la grande novità è che alla corsa per la dedollarizzazione delleconomia globale si è unita larabia saudita paese per decenni fedele alleato della politica estera di washington sorprendentemente negli ultimi 12 mesi riad sè sbarazzata di più di 19 miliardi di dollari investiti titoli del tesoro degli stati uniti divenendo insieme alla cina uno dei principali venditori di debito degli stati uniti 5 a peggiorare le cose il regno saudita si accanisce sempre più con la casa bianca a fine settembre il congresso degli stati uniti approvava leliminazione del veto del presidente barack obama ad una legge che impediva negli usa di denunciare larabia saudita tribunale per il presunto coinvolgimento negli attentati dell11 settembre 2001 6 insieme lorganizzazione dei paesi esportatori del petrolio opec ha raggiunto un accordo storico con la russia per ridurre la produzione di petrolio e quindi promuovere laumento dei prezzi 7 e anche sorprendente che giusto oggi pechino abbia aperto allo scambio diretto tra yuan e riyal saudita attraverso il trading system foreign exchange della cina cfets nellacronimo inglese per le transazioni tra le due valute senza passare dal dollaro di conseguenza è molto probabile che più prima che poi la compagnia petrolifera saudi aramco accetti pagamenti yuan invece che dollari 8 se si accadesse la casa dei saud punterebbe tutto sul petroyuan 9 il mondo cambia davanti ai nostri occhi',\n",

коллективной безопасности шанхайская организация сотрудничества и содружество независимых государств глобальный характер современных вызовов и угроз формирование коллективных подходов необходимых для их эффективного преодоления диктуют необходимость наращивания сотрудничества между организацией объединенных наций и региональными и субрегиональными организациями в области поддержания мира и безопасности применительно к организации объединенных наций это прежде всего ее универсальный характер как с точки зрения членства в организации так и ее деятельности а также всемирно признанная легитимность региональные организации в свою очередь зачастую обладают более тонким пониманием ситуации в зоне своей ответственности а в целом ряде случаев адаптированными к местным реалиям превентивными и миротворческими механизмами при этом важно чтобы деятельность региональных организаций была направлена на поиск мирного политического решения возникающих конфликтных ситуаций именно в этом контексте высокую актуальность имеют регулярные сверки часов с основными региональными партнерами организации объединенных наций в вопросах поддержания международного мира и безопасности так совет безопасности на плановой основе проводит заседания по сотрудничеству с африканским союзом организацией по безопасности и сотрудничеству в европе европейским союзом в последние годы проводился обзор взаимодействия с лигой арабских государств ассоциацией государств юговосточной азии союзом южноамериканских наций и другими регионалами как известно сотрудничество между всемирной организацией и

потокам легкого и стрелкового оружия борьба c кибертерроризмом и нелегальной миграцией области где сотрудничество между рассматриваемыми организациями и организацией объединенных наций набирает обороты это имеет ключевое значение в плане поддержания мира и стабильности на широком пространстве евразии и в особенности в центральноазиатском регионе именно в этой сфере активны три относительно молодые организации действующие в огромном регионе от восточной европы до дальнего востока организация договора о коллективной безопасности одкб шанхайская организация сотрудничества шос и содружество независимых государств снг которые наращивают свой политический авторитет в мире и вносят большой вклад в укрепление региональной и международной безопасности в фокусе внимания в ходе дебатов будет вклад одкб шос и снг в противодействие угрозам миру и безопасности в регионе в том числе в борьбу с терроризмом наркотрафиком и организованной преступностью мероприятие также позволит подтвердить нацеленность этих трех объединений на развитие практического взаимодействия с организацией объединенных наций в том числе с ее региональным центром по превентивной дипломатии для центральной азии одкб это многовекторная структура способная уверенно реагировать на широкий спектр современных вызовов и угроз с которыми могут столкнуться ее государствачлены в этой связи перспективным видится углубление взаимодействия между организацией объединенных наций и одкб в области миротворчества в рамках одкб ведется интенсивная работа по развитию собственного миротворческого потенциала в том числе для задействования в операциях организацией объединенных наций по поддержанию мира наряду c этим одкб активно содействует международным усилиям по постконфликтному обустройству афганистана купированию

планируется принять на семьдесят первой сессии ассамблеи в рамках обсуждения пункта ее повестки дня озаглавленного сотрудничество между организацией объединенных наций и региональными и другими организациями правовая база взаимодействия между организацией объединенных наций и шос по вопросам международного мира и безопасности в соответствии с главой viii устава организации объединенных наций была заложена после подписания в 2010 году совместной декларации о сотрудничестве между секретариатами двух организаций в настоящее время между шос и организацией объединенных наций налажено активное сотрудничество в таких областях как предотвращение и урегулирование конфликтов борьба с терроризмом в этих целях в рамках шос действует региональная антитеррористическая структура нераспространение оружия массового уничтожения противодействие транснациональной преступности и незаконному обороту наркотиков обеспечение международной информационной безопасности в данном контексте шос активно

универсальной организации в процессе афганского урегулирования сотрудничество в обеспечении безопасности противодействии современным вызовам и угрозам всегда являлось и остается одной из приоритетных областей интеграционного взаимодействия государств членов снг важным фактором активного противодействия возникающим угрозам является также конструктивное взаимодействие с международными организациями государства снг являются участниками всех важнейших международных документов регулирующих сотрудничество в сфере обеспечения безопасности разоружения противодействия современным вызовам и угрозам

расширение и углубление взаимодействия организации объединенных наций с одкб шос и снг на базе главы viii устава играет конструктивную роль в продвижении целей всемирной организации включая преодоление современных вызовов и угроз при этом с одной стороны эти региональные организации должны активно позиционировать себя с точки зрения задействования своего потенциала в интересах организации объединенных наций c другой самой организации объединенных наций следует продолжать уделять необходимое внимание наращиванию координации и взаимодействия c данными объединениями при строгом соблюдении прерогатив всемирной организации и ее совета безопасности в этом контексте мы хотели бы предложить государствам членам организации объединенных наций изложить собственное видение путей укрепления безопасности региона евразии с опорой на имеющиеся региональные механизмы очевидно что стабильность в этом макрорегионе станет фундаментом для экономического роста и государственного строительства стран евразии поэтому мы были бы признательны за соображения делегаций в том числе и в плане увязки безопасности и развития убеждены что здесь в рамках всемирной организации обладающей универсальной легитимностью нам сообща будет по силам предложить инновационные подходы к вопросам стабилизации уязвимых регионов которые впоследствии могут быть применены и к другим частям планеты

analyse des armes dont les étatsunis se sont dotés pour dominer lensemble du monde cet article est dautant plus important que cest cette domination clairement assumée cette organisation unipolaire du monde que la syrie la russie et la chine mettent aujourdhui en cause les armes à la main réseau voltaire rome italie 27 octobre 2016 je vais tout de suite au nœud de la question je pense quon ne peut pas parler de relations entre union européenne et chine indépendamment de linfluence que les étatsunis exercent sur lunion européenne directement et par lintermédiaire de lotan aujourdhui 22 des 28 pays de lue 21 sur 27 après la sortie du royaumeuni de lue avec plus de 90 de la population de lunion font partie de lotan reconnue par lue comme fondement de la défense collective et lotan est sous commandement us le commandant suprême allié en europe est toujours nommé par le président des étatsunis damérique et tous les autres commandements clé sont aux mains des usa la politique étrangère et militaire de lunion européenne est ainsi fondamentalement subordonnée à la stratégie étatsunienne sur laquelle convergent les plus grandes puissances européennes cette stratégie clairement énoncée dans les documents officiels est tracée au moment historique où la situation mondiale change à la suite de la désagrégation de lurss en 1991 la maisonblanche déclare dans la national security strategy united states les étatsunis demeurent le seul état avec une force une portée et une influence en toute dimension politique économique et militaire réellement globales il nexiste aucun substitut au leadership américain en 1992 dans la defense planning guidance le pentagone souligne notre premier objectif est dempêcher quune quelconque puissance domine une région dont les ressources seraient suffisantes pour engendrer une puissance mondiale ces régions comprennent leurope occidentale lasie orientale le territoire de lexunion soviétique et lasie sudoccidentale en 2001 dans le rapport quadrennial defense review publié une semaine avant la guerre usaotan en afghanistan aire de première importance géostratégique à légard de russie et chine le pentagone annonce la possibilité existe quémerge dans la région un rival militaire avec une formidable base de ressources nos forces armées doivent conserver la capacité dimposer la volonté des étatsunis à nimporte quel adversaire compris états et entités nonétatiques de façon à changer le régime dun état adverse ou occuper un territoire étranger jusquà ce que les objectifs stratégiques étatsuniens soient réalisés sur la base de cette stratégie lotan sous commandement us lancé son offensive sur le front oriental après avoir démoli par la guerre la fédération yougoslave de 1999 à aujourdhui elle englobé tous les états de lexpacte de varsovie trois de lexyougoslavie trois de lexurss et sous peu elle en englobera dautres à commencer par la géorgie et lukraine cette dernière étant de fait déjà dans lotan en déplaçant bases et forces compris nucléaires toujours plus près de la russie en même temps sur le front méridional étroitement relié à celui oriental lotan sous commandement us démoli par la guerre létat libyen et essayé den faire autant avec celui de la syrie les usa et lotan ont fait exploser la crise ukrainienne et accusant la russie de déstabiliser la sécurité européenne ils ont entraîné leurope dans une nouvelle guerre froide voulue surtout par washington aux dépens des économies européennes à qui les sanctions et contresanctions ont porté préjudice pour casser les rapports économiques et politiques russieue néfastes aux intérêts étatsuniens cest dans la même stratégie quentre le déplacement croissant de forces militaires étatsuniennes dans la région asiepacifique dans une fonction antichinoise lus navy annoncé quen 2020 elle concentrera dans cette région 60 de ses forces navales et aériennes la stratégie étatsunienne est focalisée sur la mer de chine méridionale dont lamiral harris chef du commandement us pour le pacifique souligne limportance cest là que passe un commerce maritime dune valeur annuelle de plus de 5 000 milliards de dollars dont 25 de lexport mondial de pétrole et 50 de celui du gaz naturel les usa veulent contrôler cette voie maritime au nom de celle que lamiral harris définit comme une liberté de naviguer fondamentale pour notre système de vie ici aux étatsunis en accusant la chine actions agressives en mer chinoise méridionale analogues à celles de la russie en crimée pour cela lus navy patrouille la mer de chine méridionale dans le sillage des étatsunis arrivent les plus grandes puissances européennes en juillet dernier la france sollicité lunion européenne pour coordonner la patrouille navale de la mer chinoise méridionale afin dassurer une présence régulière et visible dans ces eaux illégalement réclamées par la chine et tandis que les étatsunis installent en corée du sud des systèmes antimissiles mais en mesure de lancer aussi des missiles nucléaires analogues à ceux installés contre la russie en roumanie et bientôt en pologne en plus de ceux qui sont embarqués sur des navires de guerre en méditerranée le secrétaire général de lotan jens stoltenberg reçoit le 6 octobre à bruxelles le ministre des affaires étrangères sudcoréen yun byungse pour renforcer le partenariat de lotan avec séoul ces faits et dautres encore démontrent quen europe et en asie la même stratégie est à lœuvre cest la tentative extrême des étatsunis et des autres puissances occidentales de maintenir la suprématie économique politique et militaire dans un monde en forte transformation dans lequel émergent de nouveaux sujets étatiques et sociaux lorganisation de coopération de shanghai née de laccord stratégique sinorusse dispose de ressources et de capacités de travail capables den faire la plus grande aire économique intégrée du monde lorganisation de shanghai et les brics sont en mesure avec leurs organismes financiers de supplanter en grande partie la banque mondiale et le fonds monétaire international qui pendant plus de 70 ans ont permis aux usa et aux plus grandes puissances occidentales de dominer léconomie mondiale à travers les prêts usuraires aux pays endettés et dautres instruments financiers les nouveaux organismes peuvent en même temps réaliser la dédollarisation des échanges commerciaux en ôtant aux étatsunis la capacité de décharger leur dette sur dautres pays par limpression de papier monnaie utilisé comme devise internationale dominante pour maintenir leur suprématie toujours plus vacillante les étatsunis utilisent non seulement la force des armes mais dautres armes souvent plus efficaces que celles proprement dites première arme les dits accords de libreéchange comme le partenariat transatlantique sur le commerce et les investissements ttip avec lue et le partenariat transpacifique tpp dont le nest pas seulement économique mais géopolitique et géostratégique cest pour cela quhillary clinton qualifie le partenariat usaue de plus grand objectif stratégique de notre alliance transatlantique en projetant une otan économique qui intègre celle politique et militaire le projet est clair former un bloc politique économique et militaire usaue toujours sous commandement étatsunien qui soppose à laire eurasiatique en ascension basée sur la coopération entre la chine et la russie qui soppose aux brics à liran et à tout autre pays qui se soustraie à la domination de loccident comme les négociations sur le ttip ont du mal à avancer à cause de divergences dintérêt et dune vaste opposition en europe lobstacle est pour le moment contourné avec l accord économique et commercial global ceta entre le canada et lue un ttip camouflé étant donné que le canada fait partie du nafta avec les usa le ceta sera probablement signé par lue le 27 octobre prochain pendant la visite du premier ministre canadien trudeau à bruxelles seconde arme la pénétration dans les pays cible pour les désagréger de
